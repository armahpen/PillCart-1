Update this React project so that both the Shop page and the Admin dashboard can search products by name 
AND that product data stays perfectly synchronized between the two pages.

1. **Centralized Product Data:**
   - Store all product information in a single React state or Context API provider called `ProductContext`.
   - Load the product list from the Excel â†’ JSON datastore once and share it with both pages.
   - Any change (edit, delete, add) in the Admin dashboard should update the same central state, so the Shop page reflects it automatically without a page reload.

2. **Search Bar for Both Pages:**
   - Add a search input at the top of both the Shop page and Admin dashboard.
   - As the user types, filter the displayed products in real time by product name (case-insensitive).
   - Optionally allow filtering by category using a dropdown.

3. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Use the same ProductCard component (from the previous prompt) to display products.
   - Below or beside each card, include Edit and Delete buttons for the Admin.
   - When the Admin edits a product name, price, category, or image:
     - Update the shared product state immediately.
     - Persist changes to the datastore (JSON or API).
   - When the Admin deletes a product:
     - Remove it from the shared product state immediately.
     - Persist the deletion to the datastore.
   - When the Admin adds a product:
     - Add it to the shared product state so it appears instantly on both pages.

4. **Shop Page:**
   - Use the same ProductCard component for product display.
   - Add the same search bar to allow users to search by product name.
   - The product list should always match the Admin dashboard because they use the same data source.

5. **UI:**
   - Style the search bar using Tailwind CSS to match the dashboard/shop UI.
   - Ensure the product grid updates smoothly while searching.

6. **Testing:**
   - Verify that editing or deleting a product in Admin immediately updates the Shop page.
   - Verify that searching on either page correctly filters products by name.
